You can make something like **BlackShell** when you are bored

## 📜 Features

- **Multi-Target Control**: Manage multiple connections from a centralized interface.
- **Stealth Operations**: Operates quietly to avoid detection in controlled environments.

## 💡 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VirusNoirrr/BlackShell.git
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. Deploy the client on the target machine:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

## 💡 Usage

1. Launch the BlackShell server on your control machine and edit host, port on server.py (make sure to edit it in client.py too) or leave it as it is (default listening port is 9999 and host is 0.0.0.0).
2. Deploy the client script on the target machine within the local network or on an authorized remote system.
3. Manage and interact with the target machine through the BlackShell interface (index.html).

## Ethical Use

**BlackShell** is intended for education purpose only. I made it just because i was bored. (Please dont use it to harm people (PLEASE))
